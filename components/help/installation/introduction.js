          This is developed by the worst designer I've ever known; {me} ðŸ™„. I
          used {antd} for a very long time. It had every thing I needed in my
          projects.

        <Section.p>
          Then I came across {chakraui}. Hard to explain but
          {chakraui} felt <em>free and fluid</em>. Looking back at {antd}, it
          was <em>stern and serious</em>. - <i>`The Rich but Tough Dad`</i>.

        <Section.p>
          After a lot of consideration, I concluded that what mostly held me
          back to {antd} was it's depth in ready made components. There were
          ready made {pagelayouts} with {navbars}, {sidebars} and all the {hoc}{" "}
          I could think of.

          So I went crying; I created a {gissue} on the {chakraui} Repository.
          Then a Wonderful Designer {chrisham} posted code for some components
          she had converted into {chakraui} from other libraries. I studied her
          code, and tried to understand the conversion. Then I took some time
          studying the internals of {chakraui}. The result is Choc UI.
